          <li>
            <p>
              The growth of the internet gave rise to many important services
              accessible to anyone with a connection. One of these important
              services is digital communication. While this service allowed
              communication with others through the internet, this also allowed
              communication with malicious users. While malicious users often
              use the internet for personal gain, this may not be limited to
              financial/material gain. This is especially a concern to parents
              and children, as children are often targets of these malicious
              users.

            <h3>Cyberstalking</h3>
            <p>
              Cyberstalking is the use of the internet or other electronic means
              to stalk or harass an individual, group, or organization. It may
              include false accusations, defamation, slander and libel. It may
              also include monitoring, identity theft, threats, vandalism,
              solicitation for sex, or gathering information that may be used to
              threaten, embarrass or harass. Cyberstalking is a crime in which
              someone harasses or stalks a victim using electronic or digital
              means, such as social media, email, instant messaging (IM), or
              messages posted to a discussion group or forum. ... The terms
              cyberstalking and cyberbullying are often used interchangeably.

            <h3>Online predation</h3>
            <p>
              Online predation is the act of engaging an underage minor in
              inappropriate sexual relationships through the internet. Online
              predators may attempt to initiate and seduce minors into
              relationships through the use of chat rooms or internet forums.

            <h3>Online grooming</h3>
            <p>
              Online grooming usually refers to child sexual abuse but can also
              refer to radicalisation, drug trafficking, and financial gain.
              Grooming is when a stranger targets a child by befriending them
              and gaining their trust. Once they gain this trust, the groomer
              can manipulate the child to do what they want, which may include
              sending sexual images, running drugs, or any number of other
              activities.

          <h3>Obscene/offensive content</h3>
          <p>
            Various websites on the internet content material that some deem
            offensive, distasteful or explicit, which may often be not of the
            user's liking. Such websites may include internet, shock sites, hate
            speech or otherwise inflammatory content. Such content may manifest
            in many ways, such as pop-up ads and unsuspecting links

            <h3>Sextortion</h3>
            <p>
              Sextortion, especially via the use of webcams, is a concern,
              especially for those who use webcams for flirting and cybersex.
              Often this involves a cybercriminal posing as someone else - such
              as an attractive person - initiating communication of a sexual
              nature with the victim. The victim is then persuaded to undress in
              front of a webcam, and may also be persuaded to engage in sexual
              behaviour, such as masturbation. The video is recorded by the
              cybercriminal, who then reveals their true intent and demands
              money or other services (such as more explicit images of the
              victim, in cases of online predation), threatening to publicly
              release the video and send it to family members and friends of the
              victim if they do not comply. A video highlighting the dangers of
              sextortion has been released by the National Crime Agency in the
              UK to educate people, especially given the fact that blackmail of
              a sexual nature may cause humiliation to a sufficient extent to
              cause the victim to take their own life, in addition to other
              efforts to educate the public on the risks of sextortion.

        <h2>Security measures</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <h3>HTTPS (SSL/TLS Encryption)</h3>
            <p>
              Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) is an extension of the
              Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP). It uses encryption for secure
              communication over a computer network, and is widely used on the
              Internet. In HTTPS, the communication protocol is encrypted using
              Transport Layer Security (TLS) or, formerly, Secure Sockets Layer
              (SSL). The protocol is therefore also referred to as HTTP over
              TLS, or HTTP over SSL.
            </p>
            <p>
              The principal motivations for HTTPS are authentication of the
              accessed website and protection of the privacy and integrity of
              the exchanged data while it is in transit. It protects against
              man-in-the-middle attacks, and the bidirectional block cipher
              encryption of communications between a client and server protects
              the communications against eavesdropping and tampering. The
              authentication aspect of HTTPS requires a trusted third party to
              sign server-side digital certificates. This was historically an
              expensive operation, which meant fully authenticated HTTPS
              connections were usually found only on secured payment transaction
              services and other secured corporate information systems on the
              World Wide Web.

            <h3>Content Security Policy</h3>
            <p>
              Content Security Policy (CSP) is a computer security standard
              introduced to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS), clickjacking and
              other code injection attacks resulting from execution of malicious
              content in the trusted web page context. It is a Candidate
              Recommendation of the W3C working group on Web Application
              Security, widely supported by modern web browsers. CSP provides a
              standard method for website owners to declare approved origins of
              content that browsers should be allowed to load on that
              websiteâ€”covered types are JavaScript, CSS, HTML frames, web
              workers, fonts, images, embeddable objects such as Java applets,
              ActiveX, audio and video files, and other HTML5 features.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Cross-Origin Resource Sharing</h3>
            <p>
              Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) is a mechanism to safely
              bypass the Same-origin policy, that is, it allows a web page to
              access restricted resources from a server on a domain different
              than the domain that served the web page. A web page may freely
              embed cross-origin images, stylesheets, scripts, iframes, and
              videos. Certain "cross-domain" requests, notably Ajax requests,
              are forbidden by default by the same-origin security policy. CORS
              defines a way in which a browser and server can interact to
              determine whether it is safe to allow the cross-origin request. It
              allows for more freedom and functionality than purely same-origin
              requests, but is more secure than simply allowing all cross-origin
              requests. The specification for CORS is included as part of the
              WHATWG's Fetch Living Standard. This specification describes how
              CORS is currently implemented in browsers. An earlier
              specification was published as a W3C Recommendation
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Secure Cookies</h3>
            <p>
              Secure cookie is a type of an HTTP cookie that has the Secure
              attribute set, which limits the scope of the cookie to "secure"
              channels (where "secure" is defined by the user agent, typically
              web browser). When a cookie has the Secure attribute, the user
              agent will include the cookie in an HTTP request only if the
              request is transmitted over a secure channel (typically HTTPS).
              Although seemingly useful for protecting cookies from active
              network attackers, the Secure attribute protects only the cookie's
              confidentiality. An active network attacker can overwrite Secure
              cookies from an insecure channel, disrupting their integrity. This
              issue is officially referred to as Weak Integrity. However, some
              browsers, including Chrome 52 and higher and Firefox 52 and
              higher, forgo this specification in favor of better security and
              forbid insecure sites (HTTP) from setting cookies with the
              Securedirective. Even with Secure, some sources recommend that
              sensitive information never be stored in cookies, on the premise
              that they are inherently insecure and this flag can't offer real
              protection. Secure attribute is not the only protection mechanism
              for cookies, there are also HttpOnly and SameSite attributes. The
              HttpOnly attribute restricts the cookie from being accessed by,
              for instance, JavaScript, while the SameSite attribute only allows
              the cookie to be sent to the application if the request originated
              from the same domain.

            <h3>Age Verification</h3>
            <p>
              An age verification system, also known as an age gate, is any
              technical system that externally verifies a person's age. These
              systems are used primarily to restrict access to content
              classified, either voluntarily or by local laws, as being
              inappropriate for users under a specific age, such as alcohol,
              tobacco, gambling, video games with objectionable content,
              pornography, or to remain in compliance with online privacy laws
              that regulate the collection of personal information from minors,
              such as COPPA in the United States. The methods for Identification
              include:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                The most basic form of age verification is to asks a person to
                input their date of birth on a form. However, this depends on an
                honor system that assumes the validity of the end user (which
                can be a minor who fraudulently inserts a valid date that meets
                the age criteria, rather than their own), and has thus been
                described as ineffective.
              </li>
              <li>
                More sophisticated age verification systems require people to
                provide credit card information. However, this depends on an
                assumption that the vast majority of credit card holders are
                adults
              </li>
              <li>
                Federation Identification: MindGeek, a major operator of porn
                websites, operates an age verification provider known as AgeID.
                First introduced in Germany in 2015, it uses third-party
                providers to authenticate the user's age, and a single sign-on
                model that allows the verified identity to be shared across any
                participating website
