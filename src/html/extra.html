          <h2>Difference between GET and POST in RESTful APIs</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <h3>POST</h3>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  The POST method requests that the origin server accept the
                  entity attached in the request as a new subordinate of the
                  resource identified by the <em>Request-URI</em> in the
                  <em>Request-Line</em>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <code>POST</code> is <strong>NOT idempotent</strong>. So if we
                  retry the request N times, we will end up having N resources
                  with N different URIs created on the server.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Responses to this method are <strong>not cacheable</strong>,
                  unless the response includes appropriate
                  <em>Cache-Control</em> or <em>Expires</em> header fields.
                </li>
              </ol>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>GET</h3>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  The GET Method requests
                  <strong
                    >to retrieve resource representation/information
                    only</strong
                  >
                  â€“ and not modify it in any way. As GET requests do not change
                  the resource's state, these are said to be
                  <strong>safe methods</strong>.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>GET APIs should be idempotent.</strong> Making
                  multiple identical requests must produce the same result every
                  time.

          <h2>Google Search Algorithm</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <h3>Algorithm</h3>
              <p>
                Google Search works in three stages, and not all pages make it
                through each stage:
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  <strong>Crawling:</strong> Google downloads text, images, and
                  videos from pages it found on the internet with automated
                  programs called crawlers.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Indexing:</strong> Google analyzes the text, images,
                  and video files on the page, and stores the information in the
                  Google index, which is a large database.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Serving search results:</strong> When a user searches
                  on Google, Google returns information that's relevant to the
                  user's query.
                </li>
              </ol>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>Page Rank</h3>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  Basic Concept: PageRank is based on the idea that the
                  importance of a web page can be determined by the quantity and
                  quality of links pointing to it from other web pages. The more
                  high-quality websites that link to a page, the more important
                  the page is assumed to be.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Mathematical Model: PageRank can be thought of as modeling a
                  "random surfer" who starts on a random web page and keeps
                  clicking on links, never hitting "back" but eventually gets
                  bored and starts on another random page. The probability that
                  the random surfer visits a page is its PageRank.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The PageRank Formula: The simplified PageRank formula for a
                  page A is:
                  <br />PR(A) = (1-d) + d * (PR(T1)/C(T1) + ... + PR(Tn)/C(Tn))
                  <br />Where:
                  <ul>
                    <li>PR(A) is the PageRank of page A</li>
                    <li>
                      PR(Ti) is the PageRank of pages Ti which link to page A
                    </li>
                    <li>C(Ti) is the number of outbound links on page Ti</li>
                    <li>d is a damping factor, usually set to 0.85</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                  Damping Factor: The damping factor d represents the
                  probability that the "random surfer" will continue clicking on
                  links, rather than randomly jumping to a new page. The (1-d)
                  term ensures that pages with no inbound links still get a
                  small PageRank.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Iterative Calculation: PageRank is calculated iteratively.
                  Initially, all pages are assigned an equal PageRank, and then
                  the formula is applied repeatedly until the PageRank values
                  converge (i.e., stop changing significantly).
                </li>
                <li>
                  Link Quality: Not all links are equal. Links from more
                  important pages (those with higher PageRank) contribute more
                  to the PageRank of the pages they link to.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Treatment of Dangling Links: Pages with no outbound links
                  (dangling nodes) pose a problem for the algorithm. Various
                  methods have been proposed to handle this, such as treating
                  them as if they linked to all pages in the web.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Personalization: The basic PageRank algorithm can be modified
                  to produce personalized PageRanks, which take into account a
                  user's preferences or browsing history.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Integration with Other Factors: While PageRank was a
                  revolutionary algorithm when introduced, modern search engines
                  use it in combination with hundreds of other factors to
                  determine search rankings.

              <h3>Creation of CSS</h3>
              <p>
                Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) was proposed by HÃ¥kon Wium Lie on
                October 10, 1994, while working with Tim Berners-Lee at CERN.
                The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) developed CSS to solve the
                problem of HTML becoming too complex as authors began using it
                for formatting instead of just structuring content.
              </p>

              <h3>CSS Levels and Versions</h3>
              <p>
                CSS has evolved through several levels: CSS1 was released in
                1996, CSS2 in 1998, and CSS3 began development in 1999. Unlike
                its predecessors, CSS3 was divided into modules that could be
                developed and released independently. This modular approach
                continues with CSS4 and beyond, though version numbers are less
                emphasized now.

              <h3>Selectors</h3>
              <p>
                CSS selectors are patterns used to select and style HTML
                elements. They've evolved significantly since CSS1:
              </p>

              <ul>
                <li>Element selectors (e.g., p, div)</li>
                <li>Class selectors (e.g., .classname)</li>
                <li>ID selectors (e.g., #idname)</li>
                <li>Attribute selectors (e.g., [attribute="value"])</li>
                <li>Pseudo-class selectors (e.g., :hover, :nth-child())</li>
                <li>Pseudo-element selectors (e.g., ::before, ::after)</li>
                <li>Combinators (e.g., descendant, child, adjacent sibling)</li>
              </ul>
              <!-- </p> -->
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>@rules</h3>
              <p>
                @rules (pronounced "at-rules") are CSS statements that give CSS
                instructions on how to behave. They include:
              </p>

              <ul>
                <li>@import - for importing other style sheets</li>
                <li>@media - for responsive design and media queries</li>
                <li>@font-face - for custom font embedding</li>
                <li>@keyframes - for defining animations</li>
                <li>@supports - for feature detection</li>
                <li>@layer - for cascade layering (newer feature)</li>
              </ul>
              <!-- </p> -->
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>Box Model</h3>
              <p>
                The CSS box model is a fundamental concept introduced early in
                CSS development. It describes how elements are rendered as boxes
                with content, padding, borders, and margins. CSS3 introduced the
                box-sizing property, allowing developers to change how the box
                model is calculated.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>Flexbox and Grid</h3>
              <p>
                CSS Flexbox (2017) and CSS Grid (2017) are modern layout systems
                that revolutionized web design. Flexbox provides a more
                efficient way to lay out, align, and distribute space among
                items in a container. Grid offers a two-dimensional grid-based
                layout system, making complex layouts more accessible and
                responsive design easier.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>CSS Preprocessors</h3>
              <p>
                While not part of the CSS specification, preprocessors like Sass
                (2006), Less (2009), and Stylus (2010) have significantly
                influenced CSS development. They introduced features like
                variables, nesting, and mixins, many of which were later adopted
                into native CSS.
