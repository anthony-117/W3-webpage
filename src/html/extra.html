    <h2>Difference between GET and POST in RESTful APIs</h2>

    <h3>POST</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        The POST method requests that the origin server accept the entity
        attached in the request as a new subordinate of the resource identified
        by the <em>Request-URI</em> in the <em>Request-Line</em>
      </li>
      <li>
        <code>POST</code> is <strong>NOT idempotent</strong>. So if we retry the
        request N times, we will end up having N resources with N different URIs
        created on the server.
      </li>
      <li>
        Responses to this method are <strong>not cacheable</strong>, unless the
        response includes appropriate <em>Cache-Control</em> or
        <em>Expires</em> header fields.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>GET</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        The GET Method requests
        <strong>to retrieve resource representation/information only</strong> –
        and not modify it in any way. As GET requests do not change the
        resource's state, these are said to be <strong>safe methods</strong>.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>GET APIs should be idempotent.</strong> Making multiple
        identical requests must produce the same result every time.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Google Search Algorithm</h2>
    <p>
      Google Search works in three stages, and not all pages make it through
      each stage:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Crawling:</strong> Google downloads text, images, and videos
        from pages it found on the internet with automated programs called
        crawlers.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Indexing:</strong> Google analyzes the text, images, and video
        files on the page, and stores the information in the Google index, which
        is a large database.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Serving search results:</strong> When a user searches on Google,
        Google returns information that's relevant to the user's query.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Page Rank</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Basic Concept: PageRank is based on the idea that the importance of a
        web page can be determined by the quantity and quality of links pointing
        to it from other web pages. The more high-quality websites that link to
        a page, the more important the page is assumed to be.
      </li>
      <li>
        Mathematical Model: PageRank can be thought of as modeling a "random
        surfer" who starts on a random web page and keeps clicking on links,
        never hitting "back" but eventually gets bored and starts on another
        random page. The probability that the random surfer visits a page is its
        PageRank.
      </li>
      <li>
        The PageRank Formula: The simplified PageRank formula for a page A is:
        <br />PR(A) = (1-d) + d * (PR(T1)/C(T1) + ... + PR(Tn)/C(Tn))
        <br />Where:
        <ul>
          <li>PR(A) is the PageRank of page A</li>
          <li>PR(Ti) is the PageRank of pages Ti which link to page A</li>
          <li>C(Ti) is the number of outbound links on page Ti</li>
          <li>d is a damping factor, usually set to 0.85</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Damping Factor: The damping factor d represents the probability that the
        "random surfer" will continue clicking on links, rather than randomly
        jumping to a new page. The (1-d) term ensures that pages with no inbound
        links still get a small PageRank.
      </li>
      <li>
        Iterative Calculation: PageRank is calculated iteratively. Initially,
        all pages are assigned an equal PageRank, and then the formula is
        applied repeatedly until the PageRank values converge (i.e., stop
        changing significantly).
      </li>
      <li>
        Link Quality: Not all links are equal. Links from more important pages
        (those with higher PageRank) contribute more to the PageRank of the
        pages they link to.
      </li>
      <li>
        Treatment of Dangling Links: Pages with no outbound links (dangling
        nodes) pose a problem for the algorithm. Various methods have been
        proposed to handle this, such as treating them as if they linked to all
        pages in the web.
      </li>
      <li>
        Personalization: The basic PageRank algorithm can be modified to produce
        personalized PageRanks, which take into account a user's preferences or
        browsing history.
      </li>
      <li>
        Integration with Other Factors: While PageRank was a revolutionary
        algorithm when introduced, modern search engines use it in combination
        with hundreds of other factors to determine search rankings.
      </li>
    </ol>
