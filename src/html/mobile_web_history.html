          <ul>
            <li>
              <h3>Network Limitations</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    In the early days of the World Wide Web (WWW), which began
                    in the early 1990s, mobile phones generally could not access
                    the web due to several limitations: Early mobile networks
                    (1G and 2G) were primarily designed for voice calls.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  Data transmission speeds were extremely slow, typically 9.6
                  kbps or less.
                </li>
                <li>
                  These networks lacked the capacity to handle the amount of
                  data required for web browsing.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>Device Limitations</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Early mobile phones had very small, often monochrome displays.
                </li>
                <li>
                  They lacked the processing power needed to render web pages. -
                  Memory was extremely limited, making it difficult to store and
                  process web content.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Input methods were restricted to numeric keypads, making it
                  challenging to enter URLs or interact with web pages.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>Web Technology Limitations</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Early web pages were designed for desktop computers with large
                  screens and ample processing power.
                </li>
                <li>
                  HTML and other web technologies weren't optimized for small

              <h3>1997: Birth of Mobile Web</h3>
              <p>
                The mobile web was first popularized by the Silicon Valley
                company, Unwired Planet. In 1997, Unwired Planet, Nokia,
                Ericsson, and Motorola started the WAP Forum to create and
                harmonize the standards to ease the transition to bandwidth
                networks and small display devices. The WAP standard was built
                on a three-layer, middleware architecture that fueled the early
                growth of the mobile web. It was made virtually irrelevant after
                the development and adoption of faster networks, larger
                displays, and advanced smartphones based on Apple's iOS and
                Google's Android software.

              <h3>Mobile Standards</h3>
              <p>
                The Mobile Web Initiative (MWI) was set up by the W3C to develop
                the best practices and technologies relevant to the mobile web.
                The goal of the initiative is to make browsing the web from
                mobile devices more reliable and accessible. The main aim is to
                evolve standards of data formats from Internet providers that
                are tailored to the specifications of particular mobile devices.
                The W3C has published guidelines for mobile content, and aimed
                to address the problem of device diversity by establishing a
                technology to support a repository of device descriptions. W3C
                developed a validating scheme to assess the readiness of content
                for the mobile web, through its mobileOK Scheme, which aims to
                help content developers to determine if their content is
                web-ready. The W3C guidelines and mobileOK approach have faced
                criticism.[citation needed] mTLD, the registry for .mobi,
                released a free testing tool called the MobiReady Report (see
                mobiForge) to analyze the mobile readiness of website.

          <ul>
            <li>
              <h3>First Appearance</h3>
              <p>
                Access to the mobile web was first commercially offered in 1996,
                in Finland, on the Nokia 9000 Communicator phone via the Sonera
                and Radiolinja networks. The first commercial launch of a
                mobile-specific browser-based web service was in 1999 in Japan
                when i-mode was launched by NTT DoCoMo. Evolution of mobile web
                standards The mobile web primarily utilizes lightweight pages
                like this one written in Extensible Hypertext Markup Language
                (XHTML) or Wireless Markup Language (WML) to deliver content to
                mobile devices. Many new mobile browsers are moving beyond these
                limits by supporting a wider range of Web formats, including
                variants of HTML commonly found on the desktop web.

              <h3>Wireless Application Protocol</h3>
              <p>
                Introduced in 1999, WAP allowed at launch users with compatible
                mobile devices to browse content such as news, weather and
                sports scores provided by mobile network operators, specially
                designed for the limited capabilities of a mobile device
              </p>
              <p>
                WAP sites are written in WML, a markup language. WAP provides
                content in the form of decks, which have several cards: decks
                are similar to HTML web pages as they are the unit of data
                transmission used by WAP and each have their own unique URL, and
                cards are elements such as text or buttons which can be seen by
                a user. WAP has URLs which can be typed into an address bar
                which is similar to URLs in HTTP. Relative URLs in WAP are used
                for navigating within a deck, and Absolute URLs in WAP are used
                for navigating between decks. WAP was designed to operate in
                bandwidth-constrained networks by using data compression before
                transmitting data to users. This protocol suite allows a
                terminal to transmit requests that have an HTTP or HTTPS
                equivalent to a WAP gateway; the gateway translates requests
                into plain HTTP. WAP decks are delivered through a proxy which
                checks decks for WML syntax correctness and consistency, which
                improves the user experience in resource-constrained mobile
                phones. WAP cannot guarantee how content will appear on a
                screen, because WAP elements are treated as hints to accommodate
                the capabilities of each mobile device. For example some mobile
                phones do not support graphics/images or italics

              <h3>i-mode</h3>
              <p>
                NTT DoCoMo's i-mode is a mobile internet (distinct from wireless
                internet) service popular in Japan. Unlike Wireless Application
                Protocols, i-mode encompasses a wider variety of internet
                standards, including web access, e-mail, and the packet-switched
                network that delivers the data. i-mode users also have access to
                other various services such as: sports results, weather
                forecasts, games, financial services, and ticket booking.
                Content is provided by specialised services, typically from the
                mobile carrier, which allows them to have tighter control over
                billing
              </p>
              <p>
                i-mode borrows from DoCoMo proprietary protocols ALP (HTTP) and
                TLP (TCP, UDP), as well as fixed Internet data formats such as
                C-HTML, a subset of the HTML language designed by DoCoMo. C-HTML
                was designed for small devices (e.g. cellular phones) with
                hardware restrictions such as lower memory, low-power CPUs with
                limited or no storage capabilities, small monochrome display
                screens, single-character fonts and limited input methods. As a
                simpler form of HTML, C-HTML does not support tables, image
                maps, multiple fonts and styling of fonts, background colors and
                images, frames, or style sheets, and is limited to a
                monochromatic display.

              <h3>Early Days</h3>
              <p>
                Historically, early feature phones were restricted to only
                displaying pages specifically designed for mobile use, written
                in XHTML Mobile Profile (WAP 2.0), or WML (which evolved from
                HDML). WML and HDML are stripped-down formats suitable for
                transmission across limited bandwidth, and wireless data
                connection called WAP. In Japan, DoCoMo defined the i-mode
                service based on i-mode HTML, which is an extension of Compact
                HTML (C-HTML), a simple subset of HTML.

              <h3>Scalable Vector Graphics</h3>
              <p>
                SVG has been in development within the World Wide Web Consortium
                (W3C) since 1999 after six competing proposals for vector
                graphics languages had been submitted to the consortium during
                1998 (see below). The early SVG Working Group decided not to
                develop any of the commercial submissions, but to create a new
                markup language that was informed by but not really based on any
                of them
              </p>
              <p>
                SVG images are defined in a vector graphics format and stored in
                XML text files. SVG images can thus be scaled in size without
                loss of quality, and SVG files can be searched, indexed,
                scripted, and compressed. The XML text files can be created and
                edited with text editors or vector graphics editors, and are
                rendered by most web browsers. If used for images, SVG can host
                scripts or CSS, potentially leading to cross-site scripting
                attacks or other security vulnerabilities.

          <h2>Mobile Web Technologies</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <h3>WML</h3>
              <p>
                WML stands for Wireless Mark-up Language and was created in
                1998. Before that, there was no standard used specifically for
                mobile devices. Just like web browsers use HTML for content
                structure, older mobile device browsers use WML - if you need to
                support really old mobile phones using WML browsers, you will
                need to know about it. WML is XML-based (an XML vocabulary just
                like XHTML and MathML, but not HTML) and does not use the same
                metaphor as HTML. HTML is a single document with some metadata
                packed away in the head, and a body encapsulating the visible
                page. With WML, the metaphor does not envisage a page, but
                rather a deck of cards. A WML file might have several pages or
                cards contained within it.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>Compact HTML</h3>
              <p>
                Around the same time as WML was created, CHTML was also born.
                CHTML stands for Compact HTML and is a subset of early versions
                of HTML from the late nineties. Since CHTML is much more like
                HTML it can be viewed in regular desktop browsers. Even back in
                1998, they were beginning to realize the difficulty with
                maintaining multiple versions of a single Web site. Eventually,
                CHTML evolved into i-mode HTML in Japan, but it has since been
                superseded by XHTML Basic and then XHTML Mobile Profile
                elsewhere. The use of Compact HTML has been relegated to
                history, but it was a perfect demonstration of the forward
                thinking of its creators in following the One Web philosophy.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>XHTML mobile profile</h3>
              <p>
                XHTML-MP is a subset of the XHTML mark-up, which is very similar
                to regular HTML but with a few more restrictions. Knowing
                standard HTML gets you 99% of the way towards understanding
                XHTML and XHTML-MP. The history of XHTML-MP is an interesting
                one. After WML, XHTML-MP was independently proposed to bring
                mobile mark-up inline with the XHTML/HTML that developers were
                used to coding. The W3C decided to also get in on the game and
                created XHTML-Basic, which was very similar to XHTML-MP with the
                same intent. Then XHTML-MP 1.2 came about to add some
                functionality into the mark-up and XHTML-Basic version 1.1
                appeared, echoing this. These two standards are pretty much
                interchangeable in terms of functionality. Since XHTML-MP and
                XHTML-Basic are a subset of XHTML, they have more restrictions
                than standard HTML. This keeps mobile devices from having to
                support large amounts of code and processing that are used only
                by a small amount of sites.

              <h3>XHTML</h3>
              <p>
                Extensible HyperText Markup Language (XHTML) is part of the
                family of XML markup languages which mirrors or extends versions
                of the widely used HyperText Markup Language (HTML), the
                language in which Web pages are formulated. While HTML, prior to
                HTML5, was defined as an application of Standard Generalized
                Markup Language (SGML), a flexible markup language framework,
                XHTML is an application of XML, a more restrictive subset of
                SGML. XHTML documents are well-formed and may therefore be
                parsed using standard XML parsers, unlike HTML, which requires a
                lenient HTML-specific parser

          <h2>Responsive Web Design Era (2010 - 2015)</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <h3>Introduction of RWD</h3>
              <p>
                Responsive web design (RWD) or responsive design is an approach
                to web design that aims to make web pages render well on a
                variety of devices and window or screen sizes from minimum to
                maximum display size to ensure usability and satisfaction.
              </p>
              <p>
                A responsive design adapts the web-page layout to the viewing
                environment by using techniques such as fluid proportion-based
                grids, flexible images, and CSS3 media queries, an extension of
                the @media rule, in the following ways:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  The fluid grid concept calls for page element sizing to be in
                  relative units like percentages, rather than absolute units
                  like pixels or points.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Flexible images are also sized in relative units, so as to
                  prevent them from displaying outside their containing element
                </li>
                <li>
                  Media queries allow the page to use different CSS style rules
                  based on characteristics of the device the site is being
                  displayed on, e.g. width of the rendering surface (browser
                  window width or physical display size).
                </li>
                <li>
                  Responsive layouts automatically adjust and adapt to any
                  device screen size, whether it is a desktop, a laptop, a
                  tablet, or a mobile phone.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>

              <h3>Bootstrap</h3>
              <p>
                Bootstrap is an HTML, CSS and JS library that focuses on
                simplifying the development of informative web pages (as opposed
                to web applications). The primary purpose of adding it to a web
                project is to apply Bootstrap's choices of color, size, font and
                layout to that project. As such, the primary factor is whether
                the developers in charge find those choices to their liking.
                Once added to a project, Bootstrap provides basic style
                definitions for all HTML elements. The result is a uniform
                appearance for prose, tables and form elements across web
                browsers. In addition, developers can take advantage of CSS
                classes defined in Bootstrap to further customize the appearance
                of their contents. For example, Bootstrap has provisioned for
                light- and dark-colored tables, page headings, more prominent
                pull quotes, and text with a highlight.

              <h3>Progress Web App</h3>
              <p>
                A progressive web application (PWA), or progressive web app, is
                a type of application software delivered through the web, built
                using common web technologies including HTML, CSS, JavaScript,
                and WebAssembly. It is intended to work on any platform with a
                standards-compliant browser, including desktop and mobile
                devices. Since a progressive web app is a type of webpage or
                website known as a web application, it does not require separate
                bundling or distribution. Developers can simply publish the web
                application online, ensure that it meets baseline installation
                requirements and ensure that users will be able to add the
                application to their home screen. Publishing the app to digital
                distribution systems like the Apple App Store or Google Play is
                optional
