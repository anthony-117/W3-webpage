        <h2>What is a Web Browser</h2>
        <p>
          A web browser is a software application for retrieving, presenting and
          traversing information resources on the World Wide Web. It further
          provides for the capture or input of information which may be returned
          to the presenting system, then stored or processed as necessary. The
          method of accessing a particular page or content is achieved by
          entering its address, known as a Uniform Resource Identifier or URI.
          This may be a web page, image, video, or other piece of content.
          Hyperlinks present in resources enable users easily to navigate their
          browsers to related resources. A web browser can also be defined as an
          application software or program designed to enable users to access,
          retrieve and view documents and other resources on the Internet.
        </p>
        <p>
          Precursors to the web browser emerged in the form of hyperlinked
          applications during the mid and late 1980s, and following these, Tim
          Berners-Lee is credited with developing, in 1990, both the first web
          server, and the first web browser, called WorldWideWeb (no spaces) and
          later renamed Nexus. Many others were soon developed, with Marc
          Andreessen's 1993 Mosaic (later Netscape), being particularly easy to
          use and install, and often credited with sparking the internet boom of
          the 1990s. Today, the major web browsers are Chrome, Safari, Firefox,
          Opera, and Edge.
