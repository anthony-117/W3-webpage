                is a hypothetical electromechanical device for interacting with
                microform documents and described in Vannevar Bush's 1945
                article
                <a
                  href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/As_We_May_Think"

                  >"As We May Think" </a
                >. Bush envisioned the memex as a device in which individuals
                would compress and store all of their books, records, and
                communications, "mechanized so that it may be consulted with
                exceeding speed and flexibility". The individual was supposed to
                use the memex as an automatic personal filing system, making the
                memex "an enlarged intimate supplement to his memory".
                <br />
                The concept of the memex influenced the development of early
                hypertext systems, eventually leading to the creation of the
                World Wide Web, and personal knowledge base software.
                <br />
                The hypothetical implementation depicted by Bush for the purpose
                of concrete illustration was based upon a document bookmark list
                of static microfilm pages and lacked a true hypertext system,
                where parts of pages would have internal structure beyond the
                common textual format.

              <figure></figure>
              <p>
                ARPANET, created by the Advanced Research Projects Agency in
                1969, was an early computer network that used packet-switching.
                It was designed to be a secure communication medium for
                sensitive military data and research collaboration among leading
                US institutions. ARPANET initially ran on Network Control
                Protocol (NCP) and later transitioned to TCP/IP, making it a
                crucial part of the emerging Internet. The network's robust
                design included multiple nodes and telecommunication links,
                ensuring reliability and survivability. ARPANET's significant
                role in Internet development is evident in its adoption of
                TCP/IP, which became the standard protocol for the Internet.

              <p>
                The "Mother of All Demos" in 1968 by Douglas Engelbart
                significantly contributed to the development of the World Wide
                Web through the introduction of several groundbreaking concepts.
                These key elements included windows, hypertext, graphics,
                efficient navigation and command input, video conferencing, the
                computer mouse, word processing, dynamic file linking, revision
                control, and a collaborative real-time editor. Engelbart's
                vision for a Memex machine that could augment human intelligence
                laid the foundation for modern personal computing.

              <h3>1970s: TCP/IP Development</h3>
              <p>
                Initially referred to as the DOD Internet Architecture Model,
                the Internet protocol suite has its roots in research and
                development sponsored by the Defense Advanced Research Projects
                Agency (DARPA) in the late 1960s. TCP/IP, the Transmission
                Control Protocol/Internet Protocol suite, was designed in the
                1970s by two DARPA scientists, Vint Cerf and Bob Kahn, often
                referred to as the “fathers of the Internet.” Initially, the
                TCP/IP model was developed for the ARPANET, the precursor to the
                Internet.

          <h2>The Birth of the World Wide Web</h2>
          <ul>

              <h3>CERN</h3>
              <p>
                While working at CERN, Tim Berners-Lee became frustrated with
                the inefficiencies and difficulties posed by finding information
                stored on different computers. On 12 March 1989, he submitted a
                memorandum, titled
                <a
                  href="https://cds.cern.ch/record/369245/files/dd-89-001.pdf"
                  target="_blank"
                  >“Information Management: A Proposal”</a
                >, to the management at CERN. The proposal used the term "web"
                and was based on "a large hypertext database with typed links".
                It described a system called "Mesh" that referenced ENQUIRE, the
                database and software project he had built in 1980, with a more
                elaborate information management system based on links embedded
                as text
                <figure>
                  <img
                    src="/public/images/tim_berners_lee_proposal.jpeg"
                    alt="tim berners lee proposal"
                  />
                  <figcaption></figcaption>
                </figure>
                <br />
                Although the proposal attracted little interest, Berners-Lee was
                encouraged by his manager, Mike Sendall, to begin implementing
                his system on a newly acquired NeXT workstation. He considered
                several names, including Information Mesh, The Information Mine
                or Mine of Information, but settled on World Wide Web.
                Berners-Lee found an enthusiastic supporter in his colleague and
                fellow hypertext enthusiast Robert Cailliau who began to promote
                the proposed system throughout CERN. Berners-Lee and Cailliau
                pitched Berners-Lee's ideas to the European Conference on
                Hypertext Technology in September 1990, but found no vendors who
                could appreciate his vision.
                <br />
                In the process, he developed three essential technologies:
              </p>

              <ol>
                <li>
                  a system of globally unique identifiers for resources on the
                  Web and elsewhere, the universal document identifier (UDI),
                  later known as uniform resource locator (URL);
                </li>
                <li>
                  the publishing language Hypertext Markup Language (HTML);
                </li>
                <li>the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP).</li>
              </ol>
              <p>
                With help from Cailliau he published a more formal proposal on
                12 November 1990 to build a "hypertext project" called World
                Wide Web (abbreviated "W3") as a "web" of "hypertext documents"
                to be viewed by "browsers" using a client-server architecture.
                The proposal was modelled after the Standard Generalized Markup
                Language (SGML) reader Dynatext by Electronic Book Technology, a
                spin-off from the Institute for Research in Information and
                Scholarship at Brown University. The Dynatext system, licensed
                by CERN, was considered too expensive and had an inappropriate
                licensing policy for use in the general high energy physics
                community, namely a fee for each document and each document
                alteration.
                <br />
                At this point HTML and HTTP had already been in development for
                about two months and the first web server was about a month from
                completing its first successful test. Berners-Lee's proposal
                estimated that a read-only Web would be developed within three
                months and that it would take six months to achieve "the
                creation of new links and new material by readers, authorship
                becomes universal" as well as "the automatic notification of a
                reader when new material of interest to him/her has become
                available".

              <h3>1991: The Web Goes Public</h3>
              <p>
                At this stage, there were essentially only two kinds of browser.
                One was the original development version, which was
                sophisticated but available only on NeXT machines. The other was
                the ‘line-mode’ browser, which was easy to install and run on
                any platform but limited in power and user-friendliness.
                <br />
                Tim Berners-Lee had the first Web server and browser up and
                running at CERN, demonstrating his ideas. He developed the code
                for his Web server on a NeXT computer.
                <a href="http://info.cern.ch/">First web</a>
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>Early Web Browser</h3>
              <p>
                The WorldWideWeb browser only ran on NeXTSTEP operating system.
                This shortcoming was discussed in January 1992, and alleviated
                in April 1992 by the release of Erwise, an application developed
                at the Helsinki University of Technology, and in May by
                ViolaWWW, created by Pei-Yuan Wei, which included advanced
                features such as embedded graphics, scripting, and animation.
                ViolaWWW was originally an application for HyperCard. Both
                programs ran on the X Window System for Unix. In 1992, the first
                tests between browsers on different platforms were concluded
                successfully between buildings 513 and 31 in CERN, between
                browsers on the NexT station and the X11-ported Mosaic browser.
                ViolaWWW became the recommended browser at CERN. To encourage
                use within CERN, Bernd Pollermann put the CERN telephone
                directory on the web—previously users had to log onto the
                mainframe in order to look up phone numbers. The Web was
                successful at CERN and spread to other scientific and academic
                institutions.
                <br />
                Students at the University of Kansas adapted an existing
                text-only hypertext browser, Lynx, to access the web in 1992.
                Lynx was available on Unix and DOS, and some web designers,
                unimpressed with glossy graphical websites, held that a website
                not accessible through Lynx was not worth visiting.
                <br />
                In these earliest browsers, images opened in a separate "helper"
                application

              <h3>From Gopher to the WWW</h3>
              <p>
                In the early 1990s, Internet-based projects such as Archie,
                Gopher, Wide Area Information Servers (WAIS), and the FTP
                Archive list attempted to create ways to organize distributed
                data. Gopher was a document browsing system for the Internet,
                released in 1991 by the University of Minnesota. Invented by
                Mark P. McCahill, it became the first commonly used hypertext
                interface to the Internet. While Gopher menu items were examples
                of hypertext, they were not commonly perceived in that way. In
                less than a year, there were hundreds of Gopher servers. It
                offered a viable alternative to the World Wide Web in the early
                1990s and the consensus was that Gopher would be the primary way
                that people would interact with the Internet. However, in 1993,
                the University of Minnesota declared that Gopher was proprietary
                and would have to be licensed.
                <br />
                In response, on 30 April 1993, CERN announced that the World
                Wide Web would be free to anyone, with no fees due, and released
                their code into the public domain. This made it possible to
                develop servers and clients independently and to add extensions
                without licensing restrictions. Coming two months after the
                announcement that the server implementation of the Gopher
                protocol was no longer free to use, this spurred the development
                of various browsers which precipitated a rapid shift away from
                Gopher. By releasing Berners-Lee's invention for public use,
                CERN encouraged and enabled its widespread use.
                <br />
                Early websites intermingled links for both the HTTP web protocol
                and the Gopher protocol, which provided access to content
                through hypertext menus presented as a file system rather than
                through HTML files. Early Web users would navigate either by
                bookmarking popular directory pages or by consulting updated
                lists such as the NCSA "What's New" page. Some sites were also
                indexed by WAIS, enabling users to submit full-text searches
                similar to the capability later provided by search engines

                The National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) at
                the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign (UIUC)
                established a website in November 1992. After Marc Andreessen, a
                student at UIUC, was shown ViolaWWW
                <a
                  href="https://line-mode.cern.ch/www/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html"
                  >ViolaWWW First Web Simulator</a
                >

                in late 1992, he began work on Mosaic with another UIUC student
                Eric Bina, using funding from the High-Performance Computing and
                Communications Initiative, a US-federal research and development
                program initiated by US Senator Al Gore. Andreessen and Bina
                released a Unix version of the browser in February 1993; Mac and
                Windows versions followed in August 1993. The browser gained
                popularity due to its strong support of integrated multimedia,
                and the authors' rapid response to user bug reports and
                recommendations for new features. Historians generally agree
                that the 1993 introduction of the Mosaic web browser was a
                turning point for the World Wide Web.
                <br />
                Before the release of Mosaic in 1993, graphics were not commonly
                mixed with text in web pages, and the Web was less popular than
                older protocols such as Gopher and WAIS. Mosaic could display
                inline images and submit forms for Windows, Macintosh and
                X-Windows. NCSA also developed HTTPd, a Unix web server that
                used the Common Gateway Interface to process forms and Server
                Side Includes for dynamic content. Both the client and server
                were free to use with no restrictions. Mosaic was an immediate
                hit; its graphical user interface allowed the Web to become by
                far the most popular protocol on the Internet. Within a year,
                web traffic surpassed Gopher's. Wired declared that Mosaic made
                non-Internet online services obsolete, and the Web became the
                preferred interface for accessing the Internet

              <h3>Early Growth</h3>
              <p>
                In keeping with its origins at CERN, early adopters of the Web
                were primarily university-based scientific departments or
                physics laboratories such as SLAC and Fermilab. By January 1993
                there were fifty web servers across the world. By October 1993
                there were over five hundred servers online, including some
                notable websites.Practical media distribution and streaming
                media over the Web was made possible by advances in data
                compression, due to the impractically high bandwidth
                requirements of uncompressed media. Following the introduction
                of the Web, several media formats based on discrete cosine
                transform (DCT) were introduced for practical media distribution
                and streaming over the Web, including the MPEG video format in
                1991 and the JPEG image format in 1992. The high level of image
                compression made JPEG a good format for compensating slow
                Internet access speeds, typical in the age of dial-up Internet
                access. JPEG became the most widely used image format for the
                World Wide Web. A DCT variation, the modified discrete cosine
                transform (MDCT) algorithm, led to the development of MP3, which
                was introduced in 1991 and became the first popular audio format
                on the Web. In 1992 the Computing and Networking Department of
                CERN, headed by David Williams, withdrew support of
                Berners-Lee's work. A two-page email sent by Williams stated
                that the work of Berners-Lee, with the goal of creating a
                facility to exchange information such as results and comments
                from CERN experiments to the scientific community, was not the
                core activity of CERN and was a misallocation of CERN's IT
                resources. Following this decision, Tim Berners-Lee left CERN
                for the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), where he
                continued to develop HTTP.

              <p>
                The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) was founded by Tim
                Berners-Lee after he left the European Organization for Nuclear
                Research (CERN) in September/October 1994 in order to create
                open standards for the Web. It was founded at the Massachusetts
                Institute of Technology Laboratory for Computer Science
                (MIT/LCS) with support from the Defense Advanced Research
                Projects Agency (DARPA), which had pioneered the Internet. A
                year later, a second site was founded at INRIA (a French
                national computer research lab) with support from the European
                Commission; and in 1996, a third continental site was created in
                Japan at Keio University. W3C comprised various companies that
                were willing to create standards and recommendations to improve
                the quality of the Web. Berners-Lee made the Web available
                freely, with no patent and no royalties due. The W3C decided
                that its standards must be based on royalty-free technology, so
                they can be easily adopted by anyone. Netscape and Microsoft, in
                the middle of a browser war, ignored the W3C and added elements
                to HTML ad hoc (e.g., blink and marquee). Finally, in 1995,
                Netscape and Microsoft came to their senses and agreed to abide
                by the W3C's standard.The W3C published the standard for HTML 4
                in 1997, which included Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), giving
                designers more control over the appearance of web pages without
                the need for additional HTML tags. The W3C could not enforce
                compliance so none of the browsers were fully compliant. This
                frustrated web designers who formed the Web Standards Project
                (WaSP) in 1998 with the goal of cajoling compliance with
                standards. A List Apart and CSS Zen Garden were influential
                websites that promoted good design and adherence to standards.
                Nevertheless, AOL halted development of Netscape and Microsoft
                was slow to update IE. Mozilla and Apple both released browsers
                that aimed to be more standards compliant (Firefox and Safari),
                but were unable to dislodge IE as the dominant browser.

              <h3>Commercialization, dot-com boom and bust, aftermath</h3>
              <p>
                As the Web grew in the mid-1990s, web directories and primitive
                search engines were created to index pages and allow people to
                find things. Commercial use restrictions on the Internet were
                lifted in 1995 when NSFNET was shut down. In the US, the online
                service America Online (AOL) offered their users a connection to
                the Internet via their own internal browser, using a dial-up
                Internet connection. In January 1994, Yahoo! was founded by
                Jerry Yang and David Filo, then students at Stanford University.
                Yahoo! Directory became the first popular web directory. Yahoo!
                Search, launched the same year, was the first popular search
                engine on the World Wide Web. Yahoo! became the quintessential
                example of a first mover on the Web. Online shopping began to
                emerge with the launch of Amazon's shopping site by Jeff Bezos
                in 1995 and eBay by Pierre Omidyar the same year. Netscape had a
                very successful IPO valuing the company at $2.9 billion despite
                the lack of profits and triggering the dot-com bubble.
                Increasing familiarity with the Web led to the growth of direct
                Web-based commerce (e-commerce) and instantaneous group
                communications worldwide. Many dot-com companies, displaying
                products on hypertext webpages, were added into the Web. Over
                the next 5 years, over a trillion dollars was raised to fund
                thousands of startups consisting of little more than a website.
                During the dot-com boom, many companies vied to create a
                dominant web portal in the belief that such a website would best
                be able to attract a large audience that in turn would attract
                online advertising revenue. While most of these portals offered
                a search engine, they were not interested in encouraging users
                to find other websites and leave the portal and instead
                concentrated on "sticky" content. In contrast, Google was a
                stripped-down search engine that delivered superior results. It
                was a hit with users who switched from portals to Google.
                Furthermore, with AdWords, Google had an effective business
                model. With the bursting of the dot-com bubble, many web portals
                either scaled back operations, floundered, or shut down
                entirely. AOL disbanded Netscape in 2003
                <br />
                In 2000, the dot-com bubble burst, and many dot-com startups
                went out of business after burning through their venture capital
                and failing to become profitable. However, many others,
                particularly online retailers like eBay and Amazon, blossomed
                and became highly profitable. More conventional retailers found
                online merchandising to be a profitable additional source of
                revenue. While some online entertainment and news outlets failed
                when their seed capital ran out, others persisted and eventually
                became economically self-sufficient. Traditional media outlets
                (newspaper publishers, broadcasters and cablecasters in
                particular) also found the Web to be a useful and profitable
                additional channel for content distribution, and an additional
                means to generate advertising revenue. The sites that survived
                and eventually prospered after the bubble burst had two things
                in common: a sound business plan, and a niche in the marketplace
                that was, if not unique, particularly well-defined and
                well-served.

              <h3>Browser War</h3>
              <p>
                After graduating from UIUC, Andreessen and Jim Clark, former CEO
                of Silicon Graphics, met and formed Mosaic Communications
                Corporation in April 1994 to develop the Mosaic Netscape browser
                commercially. The company later changed its name to Netscape,
                and the browser was developed further as Netscape Navigator,
                which soon became the dominant web client. They also released
                the Netsite Commerce web server which could handle SSL requests,
                thus enabling e-commerce on the Web. SSL became the standard
                method to encrypt web traffic. Navigator 1.0 also introduced
                cookies, but Netscape did not publicize this feature. Netscape
                followed up with Navigator 2 in 1995 introducing frames, Java
                applets and JavaScript. In 1998, Netscape made Navigator open
                source and launched Mozilla. Microsoft licensed Mosaic from
                Spyglass and released Internet Explorer 1.0 that year and IE2
                later the same year. IE2 added features pioneered at Netscape
                such as cookies, SSL, and JavaScript. The browser wars became a
                competition for dominance when Explorer was bundled with
                Windows. This led to the United States v. Microsoft Corporation
                antitrust lawsuit. IE3, released in 1996, added support for Java
                applets, ActiveX, and CSS. At this point, Microsoft began
                bundling IE with Windows. IE3 managed to increase Microsoft's
                share of the browser market from under 10% to over 20%. IE4,
                released the following year, introduced Dynamic HTML setting the
                stage for the Web 2.0 revolution. By 1998, IE was able to
                capture the majority of the desktop browser market. It would be
                the dominant browser for the next fourteen years. Google
                released their Chrome browser in 2008 with the first JIT
                JavaScript engine, V8. Chrome overtook IE to become the dominant
                desktop browser in four years, and overtook Safari to become the
                dominant mobile browser in two. At the same time, Google open
                sourced Chrome's codebase as Chromium. Ryan Dahl used Chromium's
                V8 engine in 2009 to power an event driven runtime system,
                Node.js, which allowed JavaScript code to be used on servers as
                well as browsers. This led to the development of new software
                stacks such as MEAN. Thanks to frameworks such as Electron,
                developers can bundle up node applications as standalone desktop
                applications such as Slack. Acer and Samsung began selling
                Chromebooks, cheap laptops running ChromeOS capable of running
                web apps, in 2011. Over the next decade, more companies offered
                Chromebooks. Chromebooks outsold MacOS devices in 2020 to become
                the second most popular OS in the world. Other notable web
                browsers emerged including Mozilla's Firefox, Opera's Opera
                browser and Apple Safari.

              <h3>Web 1.0</h3>
              <p>
                Web 1.0 is a retronym referring to the first stage of the World
                Wide Web's evolution, from roughly 1989 to 2004. According to
                Graham Cormode and Balachander Krishnamurthy, "content creators
                were few in Web 1.0 with the vast majority of users simply
                acting as consumers of content". Personal web pages were common,
                consisting mainly of static pages hosted on ISP-run web servers,
                or on free web hosting services such as Tripod and the
                now-defunct GeoCities. Some common design elements of a Web 1.0
                site include: Static pages rather than dynamic HTML. Content
                provided from the server's filesystem rather than a relational
                database management system (RDBMS). Pages built using Server
                Side Includes or Common Gateway Interface (CGI) instead of a web
                application written in a dynamic programming language such as
                Perl, PHP, Python or Ruby. The use of HTML 3.2-era elements such
                as frames and tables to position and align elements on a page.
                These were often used in combination with spacer GIFs.
                Proprietary HTML extensions, such as the &lt blink &gt and &lt
                marquee &gt tags, introduced during the first browser war.
                Online guestbooks. GIF buttons, graphics (typically 88×31 pixels
                in size) promoting web browsers, operating systems, text editors
                and various other products. HTML forms sent via email. Support
                for server side scripting was rare on shared servers during this
                period. To provide a feedback mechanism for web site visitors,
                mailto forms were used. A user would fill in a form, and upon
                clicking the form's submit button, their email client would
                launch and attempt to send an email containing the form's
                details. The popularity and complications of the mailto protocol
                led browser developers to incorporate email clients into their
                browsers

              <h3>Web 2.0</h3>
              <p>
                Web pages were initially conceived as structured documents based
                upon HTML. They could include images, video, and other content,
                although the use of media was initially relatively limited and
                the content was mainly static. By the mid-2000s, new approaches
                to sharing and exchanging content, such as blogs and RSS,
                rapidly gained acceptance on the Web. The video-sharing website
                YouTube launched the concept of user-generated content. As new
                technologies made it easier to create websites that behaved
                dynamically, the Web attained greater ease of use and gained a
                sense of interactivity which ushered in a period of rapid
                popularization. This new era also brought into existence social
                networking websites, such as Friendster, MySpace, Facebook, and
                Twitter, and photo- and video-sharing websites such as Flickr
                and, later, Instagram which gained users rapidly and became a
                central part of youth culture. Wikipedia's user-edited content
                quickly displaced the professionally-written Microsoft Encarta.
                The popularity of these sites, combined with developments in the
                technology that enabled them, and the increasing availability
                and affordability of high-speed connections made video content
                far more common on all kinds of websites. This new media-rich
                model for information exchange, featuring user-generated and
                user-edited websites, was dubbed Web 2.0, a term coined in 1999
                by Darcy DiNucci and popularized in 2004 at the Web 2.0
                Conference. The Web 2.0 boom drew investment from companies
                worldwide and saw many new service-oriented startups catering to
                a newly "democratized" Web. In spite of the success of Web 2.0
                applications, the W3C forged ahead with their plan to replace
                HTML with XHTML and represent all data in XML. In 2004,
                representatives from Mozilla, Opera, and Apple formed an
                opposing group, the Web Hypertext Application Technology Working
                Group (WHATWG), dedicated to improving HTML while maintaining
                backward compatibility. For the next several years, websites did
                not transition their content to XHTML; browser vendors did not
                adopt XHTML2; and developers eschewed XML in favor of JSON. By
                2007, the W3C conceded and announced they were restarting work
                on HTML and in 2009, they officially abandoned XHTML. In 2019,
                the W3C ceded control of the HTML specification, now called the
                HTML Living Standard, to WHATWG.

                <br />
                <br />
                Early attempts to allow wireless devices to access the Web used
                simplified formats such as i-mode and WAP. Apple introduced the
                first smartphone in 2007 with a full-featured browser. Other
                companies followed suit and in 2011, smartphone sales overtook
                PCs. Since 2016, most visitors access websites with mobile
                devices which led to the adoption of responsive web design.
                Apple, Mozilla, and Google have taken different approaches to
                integrating smartphones with modern web apps. Apple initially
                promoted web apps for the iPhone, but then encouraged developers
                to make native apps. Mozilla announced Web APIs in 2011 to allow
                webapps to access hardware features such as audio, camera or
                GPS. Frameworks such as Cordova and Ionic allow developers to
                build hybrid apps. Mozilla released a mobile OS designed to run
                web apps in 2012, but discontinued it in 2015. Google announced
                specifications for Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP), and
                progressive web applications (PWA) in 2015. AMPs use a
                combination of HTML, JavaScript, and Web Components to optimize
                web pages for mobile devices; and PWAs are web pages that, with
                a combination of web workers and manifest files, can be saved to
                a mobile device and opened like a native app.

              <h3>Web 3.0 and Web3</h3>
              <p>
                The extension of the Web to facilitate data exchange was
                explored as an approach to create a Semantic Web (sometimes
                called Web 3.0). This involved using machine-readable
                information and interoperability standards to enable
                context-understanding programs to intelligently select
                information for users. Continued extension of the Web has
                focused on connecting devices to the Internet, coined
                Intelligent Device Management. As Internet connectivity becomes
                ubiquitous, manufacturers have started to leverage the expanded
                computing power of their devices to enhance their usability and
                capability. Through Internet connectivity, manufacturers are now
                able to interact with the devices they have sold and shipped to
                their customers, and customers are able to interact with the
                manufacturer (and other providers) to access a lot of new
                content. This phenomenon has led to the rise of the Internet of
                Things (IoT), where modern devices are connected through
                sensors, software, and other technologies that exchange
                information with other devices and systems on the Internet. This
                creates an environment where data can be collected and analyzed
                instantly, providing better insights and improving the
                decision-making process. Additionally, the integration of AI
                with IoT devices continues to improve their capabilities,
                allowing them to predict customer needs and perform tasks,
                increasing efficiency and user satisfaction. Web3 (sometimes
                also referred to as Web 3.0) is an idea for a decentralized Web
                based on public blockchains, smart contracts, digital tokens and
                digital wallets.

              <h3>Surface Web</h3>
              <p>
                The Surface Web (also called the Visible Web, Indexed Web,
                Indexable Web or Lightnet) is the portion of the World Wide Web
                that is readily available to the general public and searchable
                with standard web search engines. It is the opposite of the deep
                web, the part of the web not indexed by a web search engine. The
                Surface Web only consists of 10 percent of the information that
                is on the internet. The Surface Web is made with a collection of
                public web pages on a server accessible by any search engine.
                According to one source, as of June 14, 2015, Google's Index of
                the Surface Web contains about 14.8 billion pages

              <h3>Dark Web</h3>
              <p>
                The dark web is the World Wide Web content that exists on
                darknets: overlay networks that use the Internet but require
                specific software, configurations, or authorization to access.
                Through the dark web, private computer networks can communicate
                and conduct business anonymously without divulging identifying
                information, such as a user's location. The dark web forms a
                small part of the deep web, the part of the web not indexed by
                web search engines, although sometimes the term deep web is
                mistakenly used to refer specifically to the dark web
              </p>
              <p>
                The darknets which constitute the dark web include small,
                friend-to-friend networks, as well as large, popular networks
                such as Tor, Freenet, I2P, and Riffle operated by public
                organizations and individuals. Users of the dark web refer to
                the regular web as Clearnet due to its unencrypted nature. The
                Tor dark web or onionland uses the traffic anonymization
                technique of onion routing under the network's top-level domain
                suffix .onion.
              </p>
              <p>
                The dark web has often been confused with the deep web, the
                parts of the web not indexed (searchable) by search engines. The
                term dark web first emerged in 2009; however, it is unknown when
                the actual dark web first emerged. Many internet users only use
                the surface web, data that can be accessed by a typical web
                browser. The dark web forms a small part of the deep web, but
                requires custom software in order to access its content. This
                confusion dates back to at least 2009. Since then, especially in
                reporting on Silk Road, the two terms have often been conflated,
                despite recommendations that they should be distinguished
              </p>
              <p>
                The dark web, also known as darknet websites, are accessible
                only through networks such as Tor ("The Onion Routing" project)
                that are created specifically for the dark web. Tor browser and
                Tor-accessible sites are widely used among the darknet users and
                can be identified by the domain ".onion". Tor browsers create
                encrypted entry points and pathways for the user, allowing their
                dark web searches and actions to be anonymous.

              <h3>Deep Web</h3>
              <p>
                The deep web, invisible web, or hidden web are parts of the
                World Wide Web whose contents are not indexed by standard web
                search-engine programs. This is in contrast to the "surface
                web", which is accessible to anyone using the Internet
              </p>
              <p>
                Deep web sites can be accessed by a direct URL or IP address,
                but may require entering a password or other security
                information to access actual content. Uses of deep web sites
                include web mail, online banking, cloud storage,
                restricted-access social-media pages and profiles, and web
                forums that require registration for viewing content. It also
                includes paywalled services such as video on demand and some
                online magazines and newspapers.

              <p>
                The next generation of the Web is often termed Web 4.0, but its
                definition is not clear. According to some sources, it is a Web
                that involves artificial intelligence, the internet of things,
                pervasive computing, ubiquitous computing and the Web of Things
                among other concepts. According to the European Union, Web 4.0
                is "the expected fourth generation of the World Wide Web. Using
                advanced artificial and ambient intelligence, the internet of
                things, trusted blockchain transactions, virtual worlds and XR
                capabilities, digital and real objects and environments are
                fully integrated and communicate with each other, enabling truly
                intuitive, immersive experiences, seamlessly blending the
                physical and digital worlds"
